### Objectives

In this chapter, I learned

■ Construct programs
modularly from small pieces called functions.

■ Use common math functions in the C standard library.

■ Create new functions.

■ Use the mechanisms that pass information between functions.

■ Learn how the function call/return mechanism is
supported by the function
call stack and stack frames.

■ Use simulation techniques based on random number generation.

■ Write and use functions that call themselves.
