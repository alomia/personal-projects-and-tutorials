### Objectives

In this chapter, I learned

■ The essentials of counter controlled iteration.

■ To use the **for** and **do**…**while** iteration statements to execute statements repeatedly.

■ To understand multiple selection using the **switch** selection statement.

■ To use the **break** and **continue** statements to alter the flow of control.

■ To use the logical operators to form complex conditional expressions in control statements.

■ To avoid the consequences of confusing the equality and assignment operators.
