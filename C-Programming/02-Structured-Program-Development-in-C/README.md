# Structured Program Development in C

This directory contains simple programs written in C.

The examples found in this directory are useful for learning how to write programs in a structured way.

When you open any of the files, you will find a description of what the program does.

The programs are written in a very simple and structured way.

#### Objectives

- Understand basic problem solving techniques.

- Develop algorithms using the top-down, step-by-step improvement process.

- Use if and if...else statements to select actions.

- Use the while repeat statement to repeatedly execute instructions in a program.
- Understand counter controlled repeat and sentinel controlled repeat.
- Understand structured programming.

- Use the increment, decrement and assignment operators.

##### Compile and run code:

To compile and run any of the programs found here, perform the following steps.

*valid on Linux/UNIX operating systems*

1. Clone the repository or simply copy the code to a file on your computer.
2. Open terminal.
3. Go to the directory where the file is located.
4. Type the following command **gcc fileName.c** ( if you want to generate an executable with a specific name type the option **-o executableName** )
5. run **./executableName**
