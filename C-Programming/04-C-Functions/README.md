# C Functions

This directory contains simple programs written in C.

The examples found in this directory discuss the use and importance of functions in programs.

When you open any of the files, you will find a description of what the program does.

The programs are written in a very simple and structured way.

#### Objectives

- Build programs in a modular way from small parts called functions.
- Use common mathematical functions in the standard C library.
- Create new functions.
- Use mechanisms for passing information between functions
- Use simulation techniques based on random number generation.
- Write and use functions that call themselves (recursion).

##### Compile and run code:

To compile and run any of the programs found here, perform the following steps.

*valid on Linux/UNIX operating systems*

1. Clone the repository or simply copy the code to a file on your computer.
2. Open terminal.
3. Go to the directory where the file is located.
4. Type the following command **gcc fileName.c** ( if you want to generate an executable with a specific name type the option **-o executableName** )
5. run **./executableName**
